# demo-app â€” iOS
Activelook iOS demo app using SDK

## PREREQUISITE
Need to have the following software installed:
- cocoapods: https://cocoapods.org
 
## USAGE
The podfile is already created, and correctly set.

At the root of the iOS project, i.e.: `/demo-app/ios/`, run the 'pod install` 
command.

This command will create a workspace `example.xcworkspace`.

**Make sure to always open `example.xcworkspace` instead of the project file 
when building your project.**

Now you can import your dependencies:
`import ActiveLookSDK`
