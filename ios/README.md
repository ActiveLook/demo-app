# demo-app â€” iOS
Activelook iOS demo app using SDK

## PREREQUISITE
Must have the following software installed:
- [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org)
 
## USAGE
The .podfile is already created, and correctly set.

At the root of the iOS project, i.e.: `/demo-app/ios/`, run the command:
'pod install` 

This command will create a workspace `example.xcworkspace`.

**Make sure to always open `example.xcworkspace` instead of the project file 
when building your project.**

Now you can import your dependencies:
`import ActiveLookSDK`

## DOCUMENTATION
Please refer to the SDK's documentation available on github at 
[ios-sdk](https://github.com/ActiveLook/ios-sdk)
